Numerical integration with autowrap
-----------------------------------

This example demonstrates how you can use the autowrap module in SymPy
to create fast, numerical integration routines callable from python. See
in the code for detailed explanations of the various steps. An
autowrapped sympy expression can be significantly faster than what you
would get by applying a sequence of the ufuncs shipped with numpy. [0]

We will find the coefficients needed to approximate a quantum mechanical
Hydrogen wave function in terms of harmonic oscillator solutions. For
the sake of demonstration, this will be done by setting up a simple
numerical integration scheme as a SymPy expression, and obtain a binary
implementation with autowrap.

You need to have numpy installed to run this example, as well as a
working fortran compiler. If you have pylab installed, you will be
rewarded with a nice plot in the end.
