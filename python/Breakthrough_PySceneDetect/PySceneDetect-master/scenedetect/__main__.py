#     [  Github: https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/  ]
#     [  Documentation: http://pyscenedetect.readthedocs.org/    ]
#
# Provides functionality to run PySceneDetect directly as a Python module (in
# addition to using in other scripts via `import scenedetect`) by running:
#
#   > python -m scenedetect
#
# Installing PySceneDetect (using `python setup.py install` in the parent
# directory) will also add the `scenedetect` command to be used from anywhere,
# e.g. `scenedetect -i myfile.mp4`.
