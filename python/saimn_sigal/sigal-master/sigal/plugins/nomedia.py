""" This plugin offers more fine-grained control over exluded images and
folders, similarly to how it's handled on Android.

To ignore a folder or image put a .nomedia file next to it in its parent folder
and put its name into the file.  E.g.::

    content of folder:
        IMG_3425.JPG, IMG_2426.JPG, IMG_2427.JPG, subfolder, .nomedia
    content of .nomedia:
        IMG_2426.JPG
        IMG_2427.JPG
        subfolder

will ignore all images but IMG_3425.JPG and the subfolder.

Alternatively, if you put a .nomedia file into a folder and leave it blank
(i.e. an empty file called .nomedia in a folder containing images), this
ignores the whole folder it's located in (like on Android).

WARNING: When you have a pre-existing gallery from a previous run of sigal
adding a new .nomedia file will not remove the newly ignored images/albums from
the existing gallery (only the entries in the parent gallery pointing to it).
They might still be reachable thereafter. Either remove the whole gallery to be
sure or remove the ignored files/folders inside the gallery to remove them for
good.
