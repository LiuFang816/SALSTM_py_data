''' The ``bokeh.core`` package contains core facilities for implementing the
Bokeh library.

.. note::
    For those implementing their own custom user-defined models, the
    :ref:`bokeh.core.enums` and :ref:`bokeh.core.properties` modules may be
    useful. Otherwise, most of the modules in this package will not be of
    interest to must users, or be necessary for standard use of the library.
