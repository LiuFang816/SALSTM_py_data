"""
A Python Singleton mixin class that makes use of some of the ideas
found at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonSingleton. Just inherit
from it and you have a singleton. No code is required in
subclasses to create singleton behavior -- inheritance from
Singleton is all that is needed.

Singleton creation is threadsafe.

USAGE:

Just inherit from Singleton. If you need a constructor, include
an __init__() method in your class as you usually would. However,
if your class is S, you instantiate the singleton using S.getInstance()
instead of S(). Repeated calls to S.getInstance() return the
originally-created instance.

For example:

class S(Singleton):

    def __init__(self, a, b=1):
        pass

S1 = S.getInstance(1, b=3)


Most of the time, that's all you need to know. However, there are some
other useful behaviors. Read on for a full description:

1) Getting the singleton:

    S.getInstance()

returns the instance of S. If none exists, it is created.

2) The usual idiom to construct an instance by calling the class, i.e.

    S()

is disabled for the sake of clarity.

For one thing, the S() syntax means instantiation, but getInstance()
usually does not cause instantiation. So the S() syntax would
be misleading.

Because of that, if S() were allowed, a programmer who didn't
happen to notice the inheritance from Singleton (or who
wasn't fully aware of what a Singleton pattern
does) might think he was creating a new instance,
which could lead to very unexpected behavior.

So, overall, it is felt that it is better to make things clearer
by requiring the call of a class method that is defined in
Singleton. An attempt to instantiate via S() will result
in a SingletonException being raised.

3) Use __S.__init__() for instantiation processing,
since S.getInstance() runs S.__init__(), passing it the args it has received.

If no data needs to be passed in at instantiation time, you don't need S.__init__().

4) If S.__init__(.) requires parameters, include them ONLY in the
first call to S.getInstance(). If subsequent calls have arguments,
a SingletonException is raised by default.

If you find it more convenient for subsequent calls to be allowed to
have arguments, but for those argumentsto be ignored, just include
'ignoreSubsequent = True' in your class definition, i.e.:

  class S(Singleton):

      ignoreSubsequent = True

      def __init__(self, a, b=1):
          pass

5) For testing, it is sometimes convenient for all existing singleton
instances to be forgotten, so that new instantiations can occur. For that
reason, a forgetAllSingletons() function is included. Just call

  forgetAllSingletons()

and it is as if no earlier instantiations have occurred.

6) As an implementation detail, classes that inherit
from Singleton may not have their own __new__
methods. To make sure this requirement is followed,
an exception is raised if a Singleton subclass includ
es __new__. This happens at subclass instantiation
time (by means of the MetaSingleton metaclass.

how much it owes to other people's code and ideas which are in the
public domain. The idea of using a metaclass came from
a  comment on Gary's blog (see

Other improvements came from comments and email from other
people who saw it online. (See the blog post and comments
