# Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.
# 
# 
# OJ's undirected graph serialization:
# Nodes are labeled uniquely.
# 
# We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
# As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.
# 
# The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.
# 
# First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
# Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
# Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
# Visually, the graph looks like the following:
# 
#        1
#       / \
#      /   \
#     0 --- 2
#          / \
#          \_/
