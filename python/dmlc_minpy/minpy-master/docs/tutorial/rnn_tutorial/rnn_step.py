def rnn_step(x, prev_h, Wx, Wh, b):
    """
    Run the forward pass for a single timestep of a vanilla RNN that uses a tanh
    activation function.

    The input data has dimension D, the hidden state has dimension H, and we use
    a minibatch size of N.

    Inputs:
    - x: Input data for this timestep, of shape (N, D).
    - prev_h: Hidden state from previous timestep, of shape (N, H)
    - Wx: Weight matrix for input-to-hidden connections, of shape (D, H)
    - Wh: Weight matrix for hidden-to-hidden connections, of shape (H, H)
    - b: Biases of shape (H,)

    Returns a tuple of:
    - next_h: Next hidden state, of shape (N, H)
    """
    next_h = np.tanh(x.dot(Wx) + prev_h.dot(Wh) + b)
