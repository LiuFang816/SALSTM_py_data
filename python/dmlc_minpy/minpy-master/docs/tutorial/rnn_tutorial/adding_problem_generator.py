def adding_problem_generator(N, seq_len=6, high=1):
    """ A data generator for adding problem.

    The data definition strictly follows Quoc V. Le, Navdeep Jaitly, Geoffrey E.
    Hintan's paper, A Simple Way to Initialize Recurrent Networks of Rectified
    Linear Units.

    The single datum entry is a 2D vector with two rows with same length.
    The first row is a list of random data; the second row is a list of binary
    mask with all ones, except two positions sampled by uniform distribution.
    The corresponding label entry is the sum of the masked data. For
    example:

     input          label
     -----          -----
    1 4 5 3  ----->   9 (4 + 5)
    0 1 1 0

    :param N: the number of the entries.
    :param seq_len: the length of a single sequence.
    :param p: the probability of 1 in generated mask
    :param high: the random data is sampled from a [0, high] uniform distribution.
    :return: (X, Y), X the data, Y the label.
