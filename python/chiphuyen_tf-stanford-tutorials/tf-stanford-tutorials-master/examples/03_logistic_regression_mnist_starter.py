# Step 1: Read in data
# using TF Learn's built in function to load MNIST data to the folder data/mnist
mnist = input_data.read_data_sets('/data/mnist', one_hot=True) 

# Step 2: create placeholders for features and labels
# each image in the MNIST data is of shape 28*28 = 784
# therefore, each image is represented with a 1x784 tensor
# there are 10 classes for each image, corresponding to digits 0 - 9. 


# Step 3: create weights and bias
# weights and biases are initialized to 0
# shape of w depends on the dimension of X and Y so that Y = X * w + b
# shape of b depends on Y


# Step 4: build model
# the model that returns the logits.
# this logits will be later passed through softmax layer
# to get the probability distribution of possible label of the image
# DO NOT DO SOFTMAX HERE


# Step 5: define loss function
# use cross entropy loss of the real labels with the softmax of logits
# use the method:
# tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, Y)
# then use tf.reduce_mean to get the mean loss of the batch


# Step 6: define training op
# using gradient descent to minimize loss
