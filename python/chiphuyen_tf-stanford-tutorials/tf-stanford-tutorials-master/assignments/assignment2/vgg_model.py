    Inputs:
        vgg_layers: holding all the layers of VGGNet
        prev_layer: the output tensor from the previous layer
        layer: the index to current layer in vgg_layers
        layer_name: the string that is the name of the current layer.
                    It's used to specify variable_scope.

    Output:
        relu applied on the convolution.

    Note that you first need to obtain W and b from vgg-layers using the function
    _weights() defined above.
    W and b returned from _weights() are numpy arrays, so you have
    to convert them to TF tensors using tf.constant.
    Note that you'll have to do apply relu on the convolution.
    Hint for choosing strides size: 
        for small images, you probably don't want to skip any pixel
