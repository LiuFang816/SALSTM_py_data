# Simple reinforcement learning algorithm for learning tic-tac-toe
# Use the update rule: V(s) = V(s) + alpha*(V(s') - V(s))
# Use the epsilon-greedy policy:
#   action|s = argmax[over all actions possible from state s]{ V(s) }  if rand > epsilon
#   action|s = select random action from possible actions from state s if rand < epsilon
#
#
# INTERESTING THINGS TO TRY:
#
# Currently, both agents use the same learning strategy while they play against each other.
# What if they have different learning rates?
# What if they have different epsilons? (probability of exploring)
#   Who will converge faster?
# What if one agent doesn't learn at all?
#   Poses an interesting philosophical question: If there's no one around to challenge you,
#   can you reach your maximum potential?
