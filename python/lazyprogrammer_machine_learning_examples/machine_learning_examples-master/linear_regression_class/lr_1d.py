    x, y = line.split(',')

# let's turn X and Y into numpy arrays since that will be useful later
X = np.array(X)

# let's plot the data to see what it looks like

# apply the equations we learned to calculate a and b

# denominator is common
# note: this could be more efficient if
#       we only computed the sums and means once
denominator = X.dot(X) - X.mean() * X.sum()
a = ( X.dot(Y) - Y.mean()*X.sum() ) / denominator
b = ( Y.mean() * X.dot(X) - X.mean() * X.dot(Y) ) / denominator

# let's calculate the predicted Y
Yhat = a*X + b

# let's plot everything together to make sure it worked
plt.scatter(X, Y)
plt.plot(X, Yhat)

# determine how good the model is by computing the r-squared
