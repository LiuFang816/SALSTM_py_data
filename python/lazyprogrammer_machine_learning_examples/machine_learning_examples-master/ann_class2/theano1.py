# we can define a matrix multiplication

# how do these variables actually take on values?

# let's import numpy so we can create real arrays
import numpy as np

# let's create a shared variable to we can do gradient descent
# this adds another layer of complexity to the theano function

x = theano.shared(20.0, 'x')

# the first argument is its initial value, the second is its name

# a cost function that has a minimum value
cost = x*x + x + 1

# in theano, you don't have to compute gradients yourself!

# x is not an "input", it's a thing you update
# in later examples, data and labels would go into the inputs
# and model params would go in the updates
# updates takes in a list of tuples, each tuple has 2 things in it:
# 1) the shared variable to update, 2) the update expression
train = theano.function(inputs=[], outputs=cost, updates=[(x, x_update)])

# write your own loop to call the training function.
# it has no arguments!
