    This class is just a simple wrapper to use libsvm in the

    use the validation methods coming with LibSVM, they are
    much easier to access (simply pass the correct class 
    labels in svm_predict and you are done...).

    The grid search method in this class is somewhat similar
    to libsvm grid.py, as it performs a parameter search over
    a logarithmic scale.    Again if you don't use this framework, 
    use the libsvm tools as they are much easier to access.

    Please keep in mind to normalize your input data, as expected
    for the model. There's no way to assume a generic normalization
    step.
