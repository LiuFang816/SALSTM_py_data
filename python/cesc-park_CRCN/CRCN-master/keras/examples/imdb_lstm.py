'''
    Train a LSTM on the IMDB sentiment classification task.

    The dataset is actually too small for LSTM to be of any advantage 
    compared to simpler, much faster methods such as TF-IDF+LogReg.

    Notes: 

    - RNNs are tricky. Choice of batch size is important, 
    choice of loss and optimizer is critical, etc. 
    Most configurations won't converge.

    - LSTM loss decrease during training can be quite different 
    from what you see with CNNs/MLPs/etc. It's more or less a sigmoid
    instead of an inverse exponential.

    GPU command:
        THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=gpu,floatX=float32 python imdb_lstm.py

    250s/epoch on GPU (GT 650M), vs. 400s/epoch on CPU (2.4Ghz Core i7).
