pathos: parallel graph management and execution in heterogeneous computing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

About the Pathos Framework
==========================

`pathos` is a framework for heterogenous computing. It provides a consistent
high-level interface for configuring and launching parallel computations
across heterogenous resources. `pathos` provides configurable launchers for
parallel and distributed computing, where each launcher contains the
syntactic logic to configure and launch jobs in an execution environment.
Examples of launchers that plug into `pathos` are: a queue-less MPI-based
launcher (in `pyina`), a ssh-based launcher (in `pathos`), and a multi-process
launcher (in `multiprocess`).

`pathos` provides a consistent interface for parallel and/or distributed
versions of `map` and `apply` for each launcher, thus lowering the barrier
for users to extend their code to parallel and/or distributed resources.
The guiding design principle behind `pathos` is that `map` and `apply`
should be drop-in replacements in otherwise serial code, and thus switching
to one or more of the `pathos` launchers is all that is needed to enable
code to leverage the selected parallel or distributed computing resource.
This not only greatly reduces the time to convert a code to parallel, but it
also enables a single code-base to be maintained instead of requiring
parallel, serial, and distributed versions of a code. `pathos` maps can be
nested, thus hierarchical heterogenous computing is possible by merely
selecting the desired hierarchy of `map` and `pipe` (`apply`) objects.

The `pathos` framework is composed of several interoperating packages::

    - dill: a utility to serialize all of python
    - pox: utilities for filesystem exploration and automated builds
    - klepto: persistent caching to memory, disk, or database
    - multiprocess: better multiprocessing and multithreading in python
    - ppft: distributed and parallel python
    - pyina: MPI parallel `map` and cluster scheduling
    - pathos: graph management and execution in heterogenous computing


About Pathos
============

The `pathos` package provides a few basic tools to make parallel and
distributed computing more accessable to the end user. The goal of `pathos`
is to enable the user to extend their own code to parallel and distributed
computing with minimal refactoring.

`pathos` provides methods for configuring, launching, monitoring, and
controlling a service on a remote host. One of the most basic features
of `pathos` is the ability to configure and launch a RPC-based service
on a remote host. `pathos` seeds the remote host with a small `portpicker`
script, which allows the remote host to inform the localhost of a port
that is available for communication.

Beyond the ability to establish a RPC service, and then post requests,
is the ability to launch code in parallel. Unlike parallel computing
performed at the node level (typically with MPI), `pathos` enables the
user to launch jobs in parallel across heterogeneous distributed resources.
`pathos` provides distributed `map` and `pipe` algorithms, where a mix of
local processors and distributed workers can be selected.  `pathos`
also provides a very basic automated load balancing service, as well as
the ability for the user to directly select the resources.

The high-level `pool.map` interface, yields a `map` implementation that
hides the RPC internals from the user. With `pool.map`, the user can launch
their code in parallel, and as a distributed service, using standard python
and without writing a line of server or parallel batch code.

RPC servers and communication in general is known to be insecure.  However,
instead of attempting to make the RPC communication itself secure, `pathos`
provides the ability to automatically wrap any distributes service or
communication in a ssh-tunnel. Ssh is a universally trusted method.
Using ssh-tunnels, `pathos` has launched several distributed calculations
on national lab clusters, and to date has performed test calculations
that utilize node-to-node communication between several national lab clusters
and a user's laptop.  `pathos` allows the user to configure and launch
at a very atomistic level, through raw access to ssh and scp. 

`pathos` is the core of a python framework for heterogeneous computing.
`pathos` is in active development, so any user feedback, bug reports, comments,
or suggestions are highly appreciated.  A list of known issues is maintained
at http://trac.mystic.cacr.caltech.edu/project/pathos/query, with a public
ticket list at https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos/issues.


Major Features
==============

`pathos` provides a configurable distributed parallel `map` interface
to launching RPC service calls, with::

    - a `map` interface that meets and extends the python `map` standard
    - the ability to submit service requests to a selection of servers
    - the ability to tunnel server communications with ssh

The `pathos` core is built on low-level communication to remote hosts using
ssh. The interface to ssh, scp, and ssh-tunneled connections can::

    - configure and launch remote processes with ssh
    - configure and copy file objects with scp
    - establish an tear-down a ssh-tunnel

To get up and running quickly, `pathos` also provides infrastructure to::

    - easily establish a ssh-tunneled connection to a RPC server


Current Release
===============

This version is `pathos-%(relver)s`.

The latest released version of `pathos` is available from::

    http://trac.mystic.cacr.caltech.edu/project/pathos

`pathos` is distributed under a 3-clause BSD license.

    >>> import pathos
    >>> print (pathos.license())


Development Version
===================

You can get the latest development version with all the shiny new features at::

    https://github.com/uqfoundation

If you have a new contribution, please submit a pull request.


Installation
============

`pathos` is packaged to install from source, so you must
download the tarball, unzip, and run the installer::

    [download]
    $ tar -xvzf pathos-%(thisver)s.tgz
    $ cd pathos-%(thisver)s
    $ python setup py build
    $ python setup py install

You will be warned of any missing dependencies and/or settings
after you run the "build" step above.  `pathos` depends on `dill` and
`pox`, each of which are essentially subpackages of `pathos` but are
released independently. `pathos` also depends on `multiprocess` and
`ppft`.  You must install all of the `pathos` framework packages for
`pathos` to provide the full functionality for heterogeneous computing. 

Alternately, `pathos` can be installed with `pip` or `easy_install`::

    $ pip install pathos


Requirements
============

`pathos` requires::

    - python2, version >= 2.6  *or*  python3, version >= 3.1
    - dill, version >= 0.2.6
    - pox, version >= 0.2.3
    - ppft, version >= 1.6.4.7
    - multiprocess, version >= 0.70.5

Optional requirements::

    - setuptools, version >= 0.6
    - pyina, version >= 0.2.0.dev0
    - rpyc, version >= 3.0.6


More Information
================

Probably the best way to get started is to look at the tests and
examples provided within `pathos`. See `pathos.examples` and `pathos.tests`
for a set of scripts that demonstrate the configuration and launching of
communications with ssh and scp, and demonstrate the configuration and
execution of jobs in a hierarchical parallel workflow. The source code is
also generally well documented, so further questions may be resolved by
inspecting the code itself.  Please also feel free to submit a ticket on
github, or ask a question on stackoverflow (@Mike McKerns).

`pathos` is an active research tool. There are a growing number of publications
and presentations that discuss real-world examples and new features of `pathos`
in greater detail than presented in the user's guide.  If you would like to
share how you use `pathos` in your work, please post a link or send an email
(to mmckerns at uqfoundation dot org).

Important classes and functions are found here::

    - `pathos.abstract_launcher`           [the worker pool API definition]
    - `pathos.pools`                       [all of the pathos worker pools]
    - `pathos.core`                        [the high-level command interface] 
    - `pathos.hosts`                       [the hostname registry interface] 
    - `pathos.serial.SerialPool`           [the serial python worker pool]
    - `pathos.parallel.ParallelPool`       [the parallelpython worker pool]
    - `pathos.multiprocessing.ProcessPool` [the multiprocessing worker pool]
    - `pathos.threading.ThreadPool`        [the multithreading worker pool]
    - `pathos.connection.Pipe`             [the launcher base class]
    - `pathos.secure.Pipe`                 [the secure launcher base class]
    - `pathos.secure.Copier`               [the secure copier  base class]
    - `pathos.secure.Tunnel`               [the secure tunnel base class]
    - `pathos.selector.Selector`           [the selector base class]
    - `pathos.server.Server`               [the server base class]
    - `pathos.profile`                     [profiling in threads and processes]

`pathos` also provides four convenience scripts that are used to establish
secure distributed connections. These scripts are installed to a directory
on the user's $PATH, and thus can be run from anywhere::

    - `portpicker.py`                      [get the portnumber of an open port]
    - `pathos_tunnel.py`                   [establish a ssh-tunnel connection]
    - `pathos_server.py`                   [launch a remote RPC server]
    - `tunneled_pathos_server.py`          [launch a tunneled remote RPC server]

Typing `--help` as an argument to any of the above scripts will print out an
instructive help message.
