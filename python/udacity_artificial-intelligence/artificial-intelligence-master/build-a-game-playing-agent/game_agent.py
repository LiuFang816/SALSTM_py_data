    ----------

    ----------

    method : {'minimax', 'alphabeta'} (optional)
        The name of the search method to use in get_move().

    timeout : float (optional)

        time_left : callable
            A function that returns the number of milliseconds left in the
            current turn. Returning with any less than 0 ms remaining forfeits
            the game.
