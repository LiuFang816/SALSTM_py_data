            the city of Tromsø. Outside of Norway, Tromso and Tromsö are
            alternative spellings of the city.Tromsø is considered the northernmost
            city in the world with a population above 50,000. The most populous town
            north of it is Alta, Norway, with a population of 14,272 (2013).""",

            u"""Tromsø lies in Northern Norway. The municipality has a population of
            (2015) 72,066, but with an annual influx of students it has over 75,000
            most of the year. It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and the
            third largest north of the Arctic Circle (following Murmansk and Norilsk).
            Most of Tromsø, including the city centre, is located on the island of
            Tromsøya, 350 kilometres (217 mi) north of the Arctic Circle. In 2012,
            Tromsøya had a population of 36,088. Substantial parts of the urban area
            are also situated on the mainland to the east, and on parts of Kvaløya—a
            large island to the west. Tromsøya is connected to the mainland by the Tromsø
            Bridge and the Tromsøysund Tunnel, and to the island of Kvaløya by the
            Sandnessund Bridge. Tromsø Airport connects the city to many destinations
            in Europe. The city is warmer than most other places located on the same
            latitude, due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream.""",

            in Tromsø. The city is a cultural centre for its region, with several
            festivals taking place in the summer. Some of Norway's best-known
             musicians, Torbjørn Brundtland and Svein Berge of the electronica duo
             Röyksopp and Lene Marlin grew up and started their careers in Tromsø.
