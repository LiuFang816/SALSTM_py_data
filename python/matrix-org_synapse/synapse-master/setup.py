# Some notes on `setup.py test`:
#
# Once upon a time we used to try to make `setup.py test` run `tox` to run the
# tests. That's a bad idea for three reasons:
#
# 1: `setup.py test` is supposed to find out whether the tests work in the
#    *current* environmentt, not whatever tox sets up.
# 2: Empirically, trying to install tox during the test run wasn't working ("No
#    module named virtualenv").
# 3: The tox documentation advises against it[1].
#
# Even further back in time, we used to use setuptools_trial [2]. That has its
# own set of issues: for instance, it requires installation of Twisted to build
# an sdist (because the recommended mode of usage is to add it to
# `setup_requires`). That in turn means that in order to successfully run tox
# you have to have the python header files installed for whichever version of
# python tox uses (which is python3 on recent ubuntus, for example).
#
# So, for now at least, we stick with what appears to be the convention among
# Twisted projects, and don't attempt to do anything when someone runs
# `setup.py test`; instead we direct people to run `trial` directly if they
# care.
