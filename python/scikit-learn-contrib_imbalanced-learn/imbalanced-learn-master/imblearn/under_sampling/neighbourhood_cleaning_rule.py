class NeighbourhoodCleaningRule(BaseMulticlassSampler):
    """Class performing under-sampling based on the neighbourhood cleaning
    rule.

    Parameters
    ----------
    return_indices : bool, optional (default=False)
        Whether or not to return the indices of the samples randomly
        selected from the majority class.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by np.random.

    size_ngh : int, optional (default=None)
        Size of the neighbourhood to consider to compute the average
        distance to the minority point samples.

        NOTE: size_ngh is deprecated from 0.2 and will be replaced in 0.4
        Use ``n_neighbors`` instead.

    n_neighbors : int or object, optional (default=3)
        If int, size of the neighbourhood to consider in order to make
        the comparison between each samples and their NN.
        If object, an estimator that inherits from
        `sklearn.neighbors.base.KNeighborsMixin` that will be used to find
        the k_neighbors.

    n_jobs : int, optional (default=1)
        The number of threads to open if possible.

    Attributes
    ----------
    min_c_ : str or int
        The identifier of the minority class.

    max_c_ : str or int
        The identifier of the majority class.

    stats_c_ : dict of str/int : int
        A dictionary in which the number of occurences of each class is
        reported.

    X_shape_ : tuple of int
        Shape of the data `X` during fitting.

    Notes
    -----
    This class support multi-class.

    --------

    >>> print('Original dataset shape {}'.format(Counter(y)))
    Original dataset shape Counter({1: 900, 0: 100})
