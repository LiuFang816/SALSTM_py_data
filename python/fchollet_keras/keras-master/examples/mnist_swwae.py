'''Trains a stacked what-where autoencoder built on residual blocks on the
MNIST dataset.  It exemplifies two influential methods that have been developed
in the past few years.

The first is the idea of properly "unpooling." During any max pool, the
exact location (the "where") of the maximal value in a pooled receptive field
is lost, however it can be very useful in the overall reconstruction of an
input image.  Therefore, if the "where" is handed from the encoder
to the corresponding decoder layer, features being decoded can be "placed" in
the right location, allowing for reconstructions of much higher fidelity.

The second idea exploited here is that of residual learning.  Residual blocks
ease the training process by allowing skip connections that give the network
the ability to be as linear (or non-linear) as the data sees fit.  This allows
for much deep networks to be easily trained.  The residual element seems to
be advantageous in the context of this example as it allows a nice symmetry
between the encoder and decoder.  Normally, in the decoder, the final
projection to the space where the image is reconstructed is linear, however
this does not have to be the case for a residual block as the degree to which
its output is linear or non-linear is determined by the data it is fed.
However, in order to cap the reconstruction in this example, a hard softmax is
applied as a bias because we know the MNIST digits are mapped to [0,1].
