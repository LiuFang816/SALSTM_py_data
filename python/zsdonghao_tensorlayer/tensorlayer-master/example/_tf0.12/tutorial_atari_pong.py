"""
To understand Reinforcement Learning, we let computer to learn how to play
Pong game from the original screen inputs. Before we start, we highly recommend
you to go through a famous blog called “Deep Reinforcement Learning: Pong from
Pixels” which is a minimalistic implementation of deep reinforcement learning by
using python-numpy and OpenAI gym environment.

The code here is the reimplementation of Karpathy's Blog by using TensorLayer.

Compare with Karpathy's code, we store observation for a batch, he store
observation for a episode only, they store gradients instead. (so we will use
more memory if the observation is very large.)
